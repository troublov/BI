# <p align="center"> Role of protein dimerization </p>
### Spring2018 project in Bioinformatics institute

This repostitory serves as a place to store information and scripts for data processing that are obtained in corse of the project.


### Objective:
To understand whether the oligomeric structure of protein is more evolutionary preferable than monomeric 

### General plan:
1. detect core residues (CR) responsible for structure formation
2. determine how number of CR grows with protein length
3. compare obtained results with dimeric proteins
4. go further for larger oligomers (n-mers) to find the most preferable n


### Progress meter:
- [x] Start to study related literature
- [in progress] Select database containing information about proteins with similar structures and collect data
- [ ] Find core residues!
- [ ] Find relationship between number of core residues and length of aa chain
- [ ] Collect information about protein dimers and residues that form their subunits interface
- [ ] Analyse the data
